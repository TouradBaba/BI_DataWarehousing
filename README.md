## Analysis of KPIs and Insights
1. Average Revenue per Transaction KPI: With an average revenue per transaction of $5625.7580, we can assess the financial health of the organization and identify opportunities for revenue growth.
2. Conversion Rate by Lead Source KPI:
   - Email: 0.2549
   - Social Media: 0.2379
   - Website: 0.2434
   These conversion rates indicate the effectiveness of different lead sources in converting prospects into customers. Email campaigns appear to have the highest conversion rate, followed by website and social media channels.
3. Average First Response Time (FRT) KPI: The average first response time is calculated to be approximately 35.1067 days. This metric measures the efficiency of the customer support team in addressing customer inquiries and issues in a timely manner.

## Implications for Business Decision-Making
- Based on the ART KPI, we can identify products or services with high transaction values and prioritize marketing efforts or product enhancements accordingly.
- The insights from the Conversion Rate by Lead Source KPI can guide marketing strategies and budget allocation towards channels that yield the highest conversion rates, such as email campaigns.
- Analyzing the FRT KPI can help optimize customer support processes, allocate resources effectively, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

These insights can inform strategic decisions, drive operational improvements, and ultimately contribute to the organization's success.
